        <p><b>What does it do?</b></p>
        <p><li>Cyber Security is, simply put, one of the most important parts of the modern world. At a basic level,
            cyber security is preventing unauthorized operations from happening on computer and information systems,
            and in particular, to protect the information and data stored on those systems. Despite seeming so simple,
            cyber security is one of the most complex and essential parts of the IT industry.
             </li></p>

        <p><li>At the heart of cyber and information security is a concept known as the ‘CIA triad’. CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
            Confidentiality means that only people who are authorized should be able to access data. Integrity means that when someone accesses data, the data should be intact,
            transparent, and untampered with. Availability means that if someone is authorized to access data,
            they should be able to access it without trouble, and when they need it.<br><br>
            
            Confidentiality is probably the principle that comes to mind first when thinking about cyber security.
            People that are not authorized to access a system should not be able to do so. Passwords, biometrics, and encryption keys are all ways of ensuring confidentiality.
        </li></p>

        <p><li>Integrity is a very important part of information security. When someone accesses data, they need to know that it has not been tampered with, altered, or infected in any way. They also need to know that the data is what it says it is and is from the people that it says it’s from. One way of keeping integrity is with digital signatures, and encryption using public and private encryption keys so only authorized users would be able to change the data. Many of these methods also apply to confidentiality and availability. </li></p>

        <p><li>Availability is the last of CIA triad, and the most practically significant. What is the use of keeping data confidential and maintaining its integrity, if no one can use it? As much as unauthorized users should not have access, legitimate users and devices need to have access to the systems and information which they are authorized to use. </li></p>

        <p><li>Maintaining the CIA triad is at the core of cyber security. If a device is hacked, it can breach Confidentiality and Integrity. DoS (Denial of Service) attacks (attacks targeted to shut down or overload a device or server) violate the principle of availability. Having servers that are not properly secured can potentially have problems with all three aspects. Phishing emails do not uphold integrity (is the sender who they say they are?). How to maintain all three aspects of the CIA triad is essentially the main problem of cyber security. </li></p>
