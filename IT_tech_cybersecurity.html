        <p>Cybersecurity is, simply put, one of the most important subjects of the modern world. At a basic level, cybersecurity is preventing unauthorised operations from happening on computers and information systems, and in particular, protecting the information and data stored on those systems. Despite seeming so simple, cybersecurity is one of the most complex and essential parts of the IT industry. </p>
         
        <p>At the heart of cyber and information security is a concept known as the ‘CIA triad’. CIA stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Confidentiality means that only people who are authorized should be able to access data. Integrity means that when someone accesses data, the data should be intact, transparent, and untampered with. Availability means that if someone is authorized to access data, they should be able to access it without trouble, and when they need it. </p>
          
        <p>Confidentiality is probably the principle that comes to mind first when thinking about cybersecurity. People that are not authorized to access a system should not be able to do so. Passwords, biometrics, and encryption keys are all ways of ensuring confidentiality. </p>
        

        <p>Integrity is a very important part of information security. When someone accesses data, they need to know that it has not been tampered with, altered, or infected in any way. They also need to know that the data is what it says it is and is from the people that it says it’s from. One way of keeping integrity is with digital signatures, and encryption using public and private encryption keys so only authorized users would be able to change the data. Many of these methods also apply to confidentiality and availability. </p>

        <p>Availability is the last of ‘CIA triad’, and the most practically significant. What is the use of keeping data confidential and maintaining its integrity, if no one can use it? As much as unauthorised users should not have access, legitimate users and devices need to have access to the systems and information which they are authorised to use. </p>

        <p>Maintaining the ‘CIA triad’ is at the core of cybersecurity. If a device is hacked, it can breach Confidentiality and Integrity. DoS (Denial of Service) attacks (attacks targeted to shut down or overload a device or server) violate the principle of availability. Having servers that are not properly secured can potentially have problems with all three aspects. Phishing emails do not uphold integrity (is the sender who they say they are?). How to maintain all three aspects of the ‘CIA triad’ is essentially the main problem of cybersecurity. </p>

        <p>At the core of this issue is authenticating someone’s identity. If verifying a person or device’s identity could be done with 100% accuracy and trust, cybersecurity would be far simpler. All three parts of the ‘CIA triad’ would be essentially fixed! Unfortunately, however, this is not the case. There are three main ways to authenticate someone’s identity: Something they know, something they are, and something they own (Scott 2020). </p>

        <p>Something only the person knows, usually a password, PIN (Personal Identification Number), or the like, is one of the easiest (and least secure) ways of verifying someone’s identity. Passwords can be leaked, and PINs can be forgotten, but this is still a good way of proving someone’s identity in the absence of any better options</p>

        <p>The next method of authentication is by checking something that only the person is. This usually comes in the form of fingerprint scanners, facial recognition, and similar biometrics including the more exotic tests like iris scans and DNA matching. Also included in this is places only you can go, like your home.  This is arguably more secure than a password but has the downside that if your fingerprint (for example) is leaked somehow, there is no way to change it.  </p>

        <p>The last way of authentication is something that only the person has. This includes physical keys (like your house key), bank cards, and devices like smartphones, which can be used in things like 2-factor authentication. This also includes digital keys, which Google has recently used (Newman 2020).</p>

        <p>Ideally, systems and devices should use multiple or all these methods of authentication. Bank cards use multiple methods: A physical card (only you own), a PIN (only you know), and to an extent, they also use a third method: your location. Many banks keep track of the locations your card is used and may contact you if your location changes unexpectedly. Websites often have the option of multi-factor authentication: a password (only you know), and your phone (only you own). Many phones have the option of turning on biometrics such as fingerprint scans and facial recognition, which are things that only you are. These principles of the ‘CIA triad’ and Authentication form the basis of most cybersecurity. </p>

        <p><b>What is the likely impact? </b></p>

        <p>The impact of cybersecurity on the IT industry, and the world at large, has been immense and will continue to be so. In 2021, cybersecurity spending worldwide was predicted to exceed $150 billion (Gartner 2021), and with current trends, this will likely continue to increase. A study by CSO (2021) found that over 44% of security leaders expected their security budgets to increase in 2022, and only 2% expected a decrease. </p>

        <p>Cyber and information security is one of the most important features of almost all computer and information systems. It seems almost every week there is a new data breach or security vulnerability being found or exploited. Security, or the lack of it, is one of the most publicised parts of the IT industry, and rightly so, considering that cybersecurity breaches can very often affect millions of users, leaking their data and in some cases bank details or other personal information.  </p>

        <p>One example of a cyber-attack and data breach was an attack on the Sydney-based startup Canva. In 2019, a hacker made unauthorised access to Canva’s databases and downloaded the data of roughly 139 million users (Cimpanu 2019). The impact of these kinds of attacks can be immense, and they can have widespread effects ranging from the slight inconvenience of having to change a password, to more drastic things like identity theft and bank fraud.  </p>

        <p>The impact of cybersecurity issues on the IT product industry has also been huge. When designing a product, one of the first things in people’s minds should be how to make their products and services secure. This is only getting more important with the emergence of big data analysis and the Internet of things. With both the effects and the danger of cybersecurity breaches getting worse every day, keeping things both secure and up and running is the most important goal of many IT professionals. </p>

        <p><b>How will this affect you? </b></p>

        <p>Being one of the most prominent and important parts of IT, cybersecurity is something that will likely affect almost everyone, positively or negatively. It has been predicted that by 2025, cybercriminal activity will cost the world US$10.5 trillion annually, up from approximately US$6 trillion in 2021 (Morgan 2020). </p>

        <p>On a more personal level, millions of people each year have their data stolen by hackers preying on insecure systems, and with the internet and e-commerce getting more and more prominent, this will only increase in the coming years.  </p>

        <p>One thing that affects many people is phishing emails and scam calls. These are a major cybersecurity problem, and hackers often use these to gain access to people’s computers fraudulently. Unfortunately, the most common victims of these kinds of attacks are elderly people, who are often uninformed about the dangers of such attacks. However almost everyone is vulnerable to these kinds of attacks, and it is always important to make sure that emails and calls are from the people who they say they are. </p>

        <p>Joshua has personally been affected by cybersecurity issues. His family, like most others, frequently receive phishing emails and scam calls. In addition, they were also affected in 2016 when the census was shut down because of a server overload. The Australian Bureau of Statistics claimed that they had experienced a DoS attack, although it is unknown whether the cause of the outage was simply caused by higher-than-expected server load (Johnstone 2016). </p>

        <p>The effects of cybersecurity on people’s everyday lives are only getting worse. According to the Thales Data Threat Report (2022:4), 53% of businesses in Europe and the Middle East have suffered cybersecurity breaches at some point, and only 19% said that “they had complete knowledge of where their data is stored”. Because of the rising dangers of cybercrime and security breaches, IT professionals and regular people alike should be on their guard and actively working towards a safer and more secure future. </p>
