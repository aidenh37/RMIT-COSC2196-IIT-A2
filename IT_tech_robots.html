    <p>Robots are autonomous machines that come in many different shapes and sizes designed to replace human effort by performing the specific tasks they’ve been designed for such as vacuuming the floor or even assisting surgery. They accomplish their tasks by sensing their environment, computing actions to be taken in their environmental context, and then acting on their computation (Guizzo 2018). </p>

    <p>Some roboticists also factor in complexity when it comes to calling something a robot. For example, some roboticists would consider something simple - like a thermostat - to be a robot, since it senses and computes the temperature against input and acts on the computation by turning the correct system on/off. Other roboticists, however, would deem thermostats to be too simple to be called a robot and would require it to be something with a body that moves (Guizzo 2018). </p>


    <p>Due to the massive range of tasks robots can accomplish, they can be categorised into up to 15 categories. These categories are (Guizzo 2018): </p> 
        <ul><li>Aerospace</li>
            <li>Consumer</li>
            <li>Disaster response</li>
            <li>Drones</li>
            <li>Education</li>
            <li>Entertainment</li>
            <li>Exoskeletons </li>
            <li>Humanoids </li>
            <li>Industrial </li>
            <li>Medical</li>
            <li>Military & Security </li>
            <li>research</li>
            <li>Self-Driving Cars </li>
            <li>Telepresence </li>
            <li>Underwater </li>
        </ul>
            <p>Robots are a technological marvel and stand as a testament to human ingenuity as they are at the crossroads of science, technology and engineering. They are capable of performing tasks that humans from 100 years ago would never have dreamed of. These tasks range from fun to quirky, from helpful to lifesaving and could potentially change societies.  </p>

            <p>Robotics is a field with constant improvement and innovation, with various organisations producing state-of-the-art examples in their respective fields. One such example of this is NASA. NASA is leading the aerospace robotics field and has the intention of increasing utilisation in space missions to accompany and assist astronauts in many ways, including for their next manned moon mission. </p>

            <p>In 2019, NASA deployed a free-flying robotic system called ‘Astrobee’, which operates aboard the International Space Station (ISS). This system consists of three flying cube-like robots named Honey, Bumble, and Queen which serve to alleviate the workload of staff by performing basic tasks such as taking inventory, recording experiments with their cameras, or transporting items using their arms. They are also the primary testing grounds for future zero gravity robot technologies (Kanis 2022). The ‘Astrobee’ system is constantly being tested, experimented upon and improved, and NASA is intending to create an autonomous system capable of repairing and maintaining unmanned spacecraft. The ‘Astrobee’ system will play a pivotal role in this, being the ‘eyes’ of the system with its 3D mapping capabilities (Ackerman 2021; Tavares 2022). </p>

            <p>Currently, industrial robotics has an increasing presence within the industrial industry as systems can be programmed to do tasks that would otherwise be unsafe long-term, or simply too inefficient to be feasible financially. These systems usually take the form of an ‘arm’ which can be modified or configured to suit their function - just about anything in the industrial sector. An example of this is the ‘Stretch’ robot by robotics design firm Boston Dynamics, which is capable of handling the troubling work of unloading boxes off the back of a truck at a higher rate than a human worker (Ackerman 2021). </p>

            <p>Perhaps the most well-known example of robotics in the industrial industry is Amazon. They use systems known as ‘Kivas’ in their fulfilment centres which are not the usual ‘arm’ design, but instead mobile robots that transport ‘pods’ of items to an Amazon worker who then adds or removes items for packing. These robots navigate by using scanners underneath to scan the codes on the floor which tell them where they are. In addition, they use sensors at the front to prevent collisions (Roser 2019). </p>

            <p>There is a common fear of a robot uprising instilled in society by science fiction films such as The Terminator and Matrix franchises. However, robots are not capable of harming humans unless they are programmed to, and these films are only fiction with little to no basis in reality. </p>

            <p>They also fail to reflect the numerous positive impacts that robots have the potential to make, whilst others also demonstrate a fear that robotics will take industrial jobs away from humans. Even though robotics has an increasing presence in industry, robots ultimately have an overall positive effect by shouldering the physical burdens of industrial jobs, freeing humans to do less physically intensive tasks where they need not sacrifice their health for an employer. </p>

            <p>That is not to say all aspects of an industrial role will be automated, however. There will always have to be humans working alongside these systems as they are not able to fully replicate human ability. Likely, everyone from various commercial sectors will eventually utilise machines as more systems are created for purposes outside of the industrial world. </p>

            <p>One such example is in medicine, where robotics could potentially reshape the field with their extreme precision, which they could assist in – for example, difficult surgeries and other operations. Further AI developments could lead them to be able to perform surgery on their own. </p>

            <p>On another note, robots will play a large part in taking humans back to the moon with the aforementioned ‘Astrobee’ system, and with other integrated robotic systems organisations such as NASA are developing. Fields like deep space exploration are also performed solely with robots, as this dramatically reduces the risks and difficulties associated with human astronauts. The potential of robots is limitless and only bound by the confines of current technology, which is constantly being innovated and improved. </p>

            <p>Researching this topic has piqued Sean’s interest in robots and he will be keeping an eye on future robotics developments through the IEEE magazine. He will also be keeping a lookout for any examples at work as Sean works in veterinary pharmaceuticals, where most warehouse processes are manually performed due to the extremely fragile nature of the product. As Sean’s father is a mechanical engineer, and his mother an electrical engineer, albeit non-practising, he may be able to convince them to purchase a robot vacuum cleaner should the existing vacuum cleaner break down, as this is an excellent example of robotics reducing in price and becoming an accessible technology. </p>
