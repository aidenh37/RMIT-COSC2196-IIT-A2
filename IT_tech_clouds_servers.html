    <p>Clouds, services and servers refer to cloud computing which involves the process of outsourcing IT resources - for example, data storage and computing power - via accessing remote servers hosted in data centres. The 3 main types of services cloud computing can provide are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). A cloud can be private, public or hybrid, with some companies choosing to opt for a hybrid model for flexible security wherein only the most confidential data is stored privately, with less confidential data and other applications stored in a public cloud (Chai 2021).  </p>

    <p>Cloud computing technology has existed since the 1990s, but improving internet speeds and world events such as the COVID-19 pandemic have catapulted the use of cloud computing services (Dvorin 2021). It is made possible through the process of virtualisation; virtualisation allows for the partitioning of one computer’s resources, thereby allowing it to act as more than one computer for more efficient resource usage. The only resources a virtual machine (VM) can use are the resources allocated to that partition; these virtualised systems are then hosted on servers in specialised data centres where they are maintained, managed and secured (Hopping 2022). </p>

    <p>IaaS offers basic IT infrastructure resources to customers, such as free-use virtual machines allowing them complete control over managing, maintaining and distributing resources. This is an alternative to allowing the data centre to handle it for them, allowing for the utmost flexibility. Infrastructure as a Service could be compared to having all the flexibility of operating a data centre, without bearing the financial and legal responsibilities associated with operating the physical location. However, with increased flexibility comes more input and responsibilities from the customer than either PaaS or SaaS (Watts and Raza 2019). </p>
    
    <p>PaaS offers a platform for customers to build applications without the overheads of infrastructure and resource management. This service allows customers to develop applications with ease as maintenance is simplified (Watts and Raza 2019). </p>
       
    <p>SaaS offers a method for customers to distribute their applications over the web via the cloud. This service could be described as ‘deploy and go’ as a third party - usually, the service provider - manages the application (Watts and Raza 2019). All these services come with their own set of benefits and challenges, and as such, the customer should decide which service model will suit their requirements best. </p>

    <p>As cloud computing technology relies heavily on large data centres, every service provider has to constantly improve and make operational changes to remain a step ahead of the competition. For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) - a cloud pioneer - has continually updated its data centres since its founding in 2006 to maintain the high standards its customers expect. Today, they remain one of the top cloud computing service providers. </p>

    <p>AWS data centres employ many preventative measures, such as emergency power backups and regular maintenance, to maintain an uptime of 99.99%. Amazon Web Services also implement tough security measures to protect the data of its customers, by using multiple forms of multi-factor authentication, 24-hour on-site security, video surveillance, alarms and various other procedures and protocols to ensure workers and visitors are where they should be and out of where they shouldn’t be (AWS n.d.). </p>

    <p>AWS data centres are also 3.6x more energy efficient than the median US data centre, and Amazon is always trying to innovate with more efficient designs and techniques. Amazon Web Services aims to operate on 100% renewable energy in its data centres by 2025, through its 310 renewable energy projects around the world (Amazon Staff 2022). </p>

    <p>Due to worldwide lockdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and an increased need for remote working solutions, there has been a recent boom in cloud computing use. The technology has had an extremely positive business and societal impact as numerous cloud computing services allow for scaled IT resources, rather than maintaining in-house IT infrastructure and staffing. </p>

    <p>Improvements in cloud computing technology and data systems have also had a positive impact on the environment, as more appealing technologies entice organisations and individuals to migrate resources to the cloud, thus reducing the number of devices sold, and decreasing overall energy use. One negative consequence of moving entirely from existing data centres and onto the cloud however is the high chance of mistreatment of retired equipment, and social effects of staff being made redundant as they as no longer required. Cloud computing also runs the risk of several security issues attributed to hosting data off-site, which some organisations remedy by opting for the hybrid model or downtime, as one server failure could cause a whole host of other failures. </p>

    <p>Overall, cloud computing has had a major positive impact on society as more is being done on the cloud, enabling organisations to welcome the technology into their environments. Today, cloud computing technology is truly synonymous with the internet. </p>

    <p>Cloud computing technology is already affecting Sean’s daily life in unexpected ways – he realises that he uses cloud-based apps such as Gmail and Twitter almost daily, and even this report was written with the help of the technology. Sean’s family and friends also use and communicate via cloud-based apps daily. Cloud computing is already an integral part of everyday life and improvements in the technology will serve to enhance Sean’s quality of life. </p>
