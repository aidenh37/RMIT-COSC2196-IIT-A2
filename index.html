     <h2>A Group Profile:</h2> 
     <p>Individual profiles can be found in the Team Profile's links above. The individual profile page contains links to our personal profile websites, Email and personality profile data.<br>

         <p>This information could be helpful to the group because it can increase our understanding of each other and help us achieve clear and effective communication. This understanding of each other is important as before now we have never met each other and being able to work together efficiently as a group is one of the most important parts of success in this assignment. </p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>2 main tools have been utilised in our group work on this report.<br>
    GitHub and MS (Microsoft) Teams. <br>

    <p>Initially use of these tools was slow, as team members learned the new tools, understanding their processes, and how to utilise them, and continued work on their individual assigned tasks. <p>
    
    <p>GitHub has been used exclusively for the webpage component of the report, while MS teams has been exclusively used for the development of the Pdf report format. Using the 2 different tools to complete separate components of the overall assessment, has helped reduce confusion, and work duplication. Another benefit has been to produce 2 distinct audit trails. Having 2 distinct records of participation, creates a simplified data trail, and reduced duplication of audit data.</p>  
    
    <p>Aiden Howlett, setup the initial GitHub repository, and Robert Longmore was the significant contributor to the groups GitHub website, as this was his chosen body of work to contribute to the group assessment. As a result, the GitHub commit data is significantly influenced by this one contributor.</p> 
    
      
    
    <p>As the PDF document component of the assessment was created and collaboratively worked on via MS teams, and each team member contributing equally to this document. The contributor data on the use of MS Teams varies significantly, to reflect the contributions of each member as they completed their components of the assessment.  Robert Longmore had the smallest contribution here, mainly small edits and updates on the progress of the website development to ensure it reflects the Pdf document accurately, and to solicit team feedback on his work.</p>  
    
    <p>MS Teams document provided not only a record of contributors to the document, but also provided an avenue for continued feedback and discussion between contributors as the work progressed. This might have some influence on the meeting agendas, as a lot of hurdles and discussion was via the MS Team workspace, resulting in solutions and agreed changes. Requiring less time to be taken via the scheduled meetings.</p>
