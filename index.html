<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>Two primary tools have been utilised in constructing this report: GitHub and Microsoft (MS) Teams. </p>  

<p>Initially, the use of these tools was slow, as team members learned the ins and outs of these tools - understanding their processes and how to utilise them, and continued work on their individual assigned tasks. </p> 

<p>GitHub has been used exclusively for the webpage component of the report, while MS Teams has been used for the development of the main PDF report. Using these tools to complete separate components of the overall assessment has helped reduce confusion and work duplication. Another benefit seen has been the ability to produce two distinct audit trails. Having these records of participation creates a simplified data trail, and reduced duplication of audit data</p> 


<h3>Use of GitHub </h3>
     <p>Aiden setup the initial GitHub repository, and Robert was the primary contributor to the group's website, as this was his chosen body of work to contribute towards the group assessment. As a result, the GitHub commit data is significantly influenced by one contributor. GitHub contains numerous analytical tools for its users and provides in-depth data on commits and code changes, as well as analytical data on individual contributors. The site also provides data on external traffic to your webpage, if made public. </p>

     <h3><a href = "https://github.com/aidenh37/RMIT-COSC2196-IIT-A2">GitHub Repository</a></h3>

     <h3><a href = "https://aidenh37.github.io/RMIT-COSC2196-IIT-A2">GitHub Website</a></h3>

<h3>Use of Microsoft Teams </h3>
<p>The PDF document component of the assessment was created and collaboratively worked on via MS Teams, with each team member contributing equally to this document. The contributor data on the use of MS Teams varies significantly, to reflect the contributions of each member as they completed their components of the assessment. Robert had the smallest contribution here, consisting primarily of small edits and updates on the progress of the website development to ensure it reflects the PDF document accurately, and to solicit team feedback. </p>

<p>MS Teams provided not only a record of attendance but also provided an avenue for continued feedback and discussion between contributors as the work progressed. This might have had some influence on the meeting agendas, as much of the discussion was via the MS Team workspace outside of scheduled meetings, resulting in solutions and agreed changes. This resulted in less time in scheduled meetings. </p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<h3>Adam</h3>
<img src="images/adamuckeridge.jpg" align ="right" hspace="10" vspace = '10' width="30%" alt="Adam Puckeridge" style="width:225px;height:250px;">
<p>I think all members of the group worked well together, we all had similarities and differences that combined well so we could complete the tasks that we assigned each other to a high standard. </p>

    <p>We all attended each group meeting and contributed as much as we needed. (except for myself for the first week, as I had the flu). </p>
    
    <p>I found working in a group in an online environment a little difficult and frustrating. Having to use Microsoft Teams was also another area I struggled with as I have not had to use the application before, and there was a slight learning curve for me to be able to work efficiently. I feel I did not contribute as much as I could have, however, I think this was due to me missing the first group meeting where tasks were being assigned. </p> 
    
    <p>I was surprised by the level of skill and professionalism that my teammates brought to the group. </p> 
    
    <p>I have learned that I'm not a big fan of working in an online environment for group work. I feel it is much easier to work in a team when you are all in the same room together. </p>

<h3>Aiden</h3>
<img src="images/aidenhowlett.jpg" align ="right" hspace="10" vspace = '10' width="30%" alt="Aiden Howlett" style="width:250px;height:250px;">
    <p>Despite a bumpy start due to an overlap with an Introduction to Programming assessment allotted only the first week of this assessment time to complete, and some delay in organising our group and meeting for the first time, I think we quickly gathered steam and worked efficiently and to plan. It did, however, take several meetings before this plan was put in place, as none of our group members have participated in a group report project previously. </p> 
    
    <p>I believe I could have expanded more on the group’s Project Idea with time, by researching the demand for crowdsourced data by local governments, and perhaps expanding on the financial feasibility of the project with estimated operating revenue and more expense analysis. I also believe the group far surpassed my effort, as most of this document was authored by other group members. It should be noted that I prepared the majority of the meeting notes, conducted the interview with Sally Longmore, and also contributed by reviewing and editing the group’s work before final submission. </p>

<h3>Helen</h3>
<img src="images/Helenandrews.jpg" align ="right" hspace="10" vspace = '10' width="30%" alt="Helen Andrews"  style="width:240px;height:250px;">
    <p>During the 3-4 weeks we worked together as a group we were able to achieve the assignment by the due date. This is encouraging as we had good communication and were able to meet regularly to check in on the group's progress and provide assistance where required. </p> 

    <p>Our group as a whole is quite cohesive and worked well as a team to finalise the project. In future, we could improve on how we plan the assignment and due dates for tasks. Setting dates to manage the project ensures everyone involved in the group knows what expectations we have and the target date for review we are set to achieve. </p> 
    
    <p>One thing that surprised me was how helpful the team were when a question was asked of them, at least one or many within the group replied with input to the question providing the appropriate answer to the question asked. I found this very helpful in a couple of scenarios I struggled with, and the team helped quickly and efficiently. </p> 
    
    <p>While working as a group I have learned that communication is key to ensuring the project was kept on time for the due date. Without everyone contributing to the group we wouldn’t have known what stage the project was at or when it was nearing completion.  </p>

<h3>Joshua</h3>
<img src="images/joshuamccorkell.jpg" align ="right" hspace="10" vspace = '10' width="30%" alt="Joshua McCorkell"  style="width:225px;height:250px;">
        <p>Overall, our work as a group has been positive. One of the most important things that went well was work division. I believe we did a good job of making each person’s responsibilities clear. We also succeeded, in my opinion, in supporting and helping each other to complete the required work in a reasonable time frame, despite losing some time early on. Something we didn’t do, however, was set internal deadlines. This is something that I believe we would benefit from in the future, as we would have benefited from completing some of the tasks earlier.  </p>  

       <p>Something that surprised me about working in a group was the range of ages and backgrounds that were represented in our group. This is somewhat different from an in-person university experience and is something that I believe has been to our benefit. One thing I have learned about working in groups is that it is important to make sure we are all on the same page about the deadlines that need to be met and the work that is required of each member. I believe we did a reasonable job of this. However, if either of these is lacking, then the work of the group could easily devolve into an unorganised mess of confused and half-finished work. </p>

    <h3>Robert</h3>
    <img src="images/roblongmore.jpg" align="right" hspace="10" vspace = '10' width="30%" alt="Bad landing"  style="width:250px;height:250px;">
        <p>Initially, we were unsure, and as a new team, took a while to understand each other, but this was quickly overcome with the division of workload amongst us, allowing us to focus on what we wanted to learn or work to our strengths. </p> 

        <p>This division of work early on allowed each team member to focus on a set target while learning the processes of running meetings, and planning the next steps. A meeting timetable was set with the consensus of all participants to ensure max availability for each member. Whilst our meeting schedule was met, and punctual, our meeting agendas were a bit lacking. Setting internal deadlines was also lacking, but the division of work early, and understanding of what was required from each participant, negated any negative impacts.</p>  
            
        <p>As time progressed as we progressed through our workload, team communications improved, and more utilisation of the tools at hand was noted. With improved communication came more teamwork, especially regarding editing, and report content. Our audit trail became apparent as each input was captured with document comments and changes.  </p> 
            
        <p>Overall, we have worked well as a team, and met the requirements of the assessment, in learning to work together to achieve a common goal. </p>

    <h3>Sean</h3>
    <img src="images/seanDechavez.jpg" align ="right" hspace="10" vspace = '10' width="30%" alt="Sean De Chavez"  style="width:150px;height:250px;">
        <p>Despite my initial anxiety regarding group work at the start of the unit, I believe our group work went well and I am looking forward to working with them again on the next assignment. No member had an ego and despite everyone being on the introverted side we communicated well using MS Teams. Every member understood their responsibilities and came through with doing their part of the group work, and as such we got the report done without any internal disputes. </p> 

        <p>Things that could’ve gone better were internal deadlines, we could’ve set and enforced internal deadlines - but as every member knew, understood and completed their contribution, any potential issues that may have arisen from a lack of internal deadlines were mitigated. </p> 
            
         <p>One thing that surprised me was how understanding the group was when it came to personal setbacks, as I caught COVID-19 and it took longer than expected to complete my assigned section. I’m also surprised at how well the group worked and communicated since this type of thing was a first for all of us and in the lectures and tutorials, people seemed to be frustrated or having trouble with their groups. </p> 
            
        <p>In doing this group work I have learned and experienced firsthand just how important communication is - as, without the frequent meetings and the posts on MS Teams, I’m sure we would’ve been very lost and confused and worried about finishing the report on time. </p>

    <h3>Group</h3>
        <p>On reflection, each member of the group had a similar experience, that being initially hesitant in the first weeks as they learned the dynamics of group work and learned how to use the tools available to them.</p>  

            <p>Initial steps were to split the workload and set individual tasks and expectations within the team, this worked well as it gave team members something to focus on, while making rapid progress towards the end goal. As the team became familiar with tools such as GitHub and MS Teams, communications between the team members improved dramatically.</p> 
            
            <p>Once each team member had completed most of their tasks, the MS Teams document became the focus. As the team began working collaboratively on the combined report document, with communication, and help amongst team members shared via MS Teams’ communication channels and document note recording.  
            Regular meetings at regular intervals helped keep the team on track, setting an agenda and what was expected to be done to achieve the end goal. </p> 
            
            <p>Areas to be improved would be setting a more defined agenda of items to be discussed at the team online meetings, and the setting of internal deadlines and goals. Fortunately, this negative influence was negated by good communication skills via MS Team conversations and collaboration on the main report document as work progressed. </p> 
            
           <p>An efficient and supportive team dynamic quickly arose, as some members of the team were affected by illness. And the team showed good support and understanding of other team members situations. This lead to increasing trust amongst the team members, and allowed work to progress more smoothly  </p>
            
           <p> The results from this good team dynamic, early allocation of work amongst team members, combined with good communication skills, via team meetings, and while working on the report document, meant that the work was completed relatively easily, and within a good timeframe.  The rapid completion of work, willingness of team members to help, meant the team was not put under any time pressure that could create poor results and stress amongst team members. </p> 
            
           <p> Overall, after some initial hesitation, the group founds its dynamic and stride quickly, divided workload, set targets, and communicated well, resulting in a team that works well together and gets results.</p>
