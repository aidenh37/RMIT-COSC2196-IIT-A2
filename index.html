     <h2>A Group Profile:</h2> 
     <p>Individual profiles can be found in the Team Profile's links above. The individual profile page contains links to our personal profile websites, Email and personality profile data.<br>

         <p>This information could be helpful to the group because it can increase our understanding of each other and help us achieve clear and effective communication. This understanding of each other is important as before now we have never met each other and being able to work together efficiently as a group is one of the most important parts of success in this assignment. </p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>2 main tools have been utilised in our group work on this report.<br>
    GitHub and MS (Microsoft) Teams. <br>

    <p>Initially use of these tools was slow, as team members learned the new tools, understanding their processes, and how to utilise them, and continued work on their individual assigned tasks. <p>
    
    <p>GitHub has been used exclusively for the webpage component of the report, while MS teams has been exclusively used for the development of the Pdf report format. Using the 2 different tools to complete separate components of the overall assessment, has helped reduce confusion, and work duplication. Another benefit has been to produce 2 distinct audit trails. Having 2 distinct records of participation, creates a simplified data trail, and reduced duplication of audit data.</p>  
    
    <p>Aiden Howlett, setup the initial GitHub repository, and Robert Longmore was the significant contributor to the groups GitHub website, as this was his chosen body of work to contribute to the group assessment. As a result, the GitHub commit data is significantly influenced by this one contributor.</p> 
    
      
    
    <p>As the PDF document component of the assessment was created and collaboratively worked on via MS teams, and each team member contributing equally to this document. The contributor data on the use of MS Teams varies significantly, to reflect the contributions of each member as they completed their components of the assessment.  Robert Longmore had the smallest contribution here, mainly small edits and updates on the progress of the website development to ensure it reflects the Pdf document accurately, and to solicit team feedback on his work.</p>  
    
    <p>MS Teams document provided not only a record of contributors to the document, but also provided an avenue for continued feedback and discussion between contributors as the work progressed. This might have some influence on the meeting agendas, as a lot of hurdles and discussion was via the MS Team workspace, resulting in solutions and agreed changes. Requiring less time to be taken via the scheduled meetings.</p>

    <p>Despite a bumpy start due to an overlap with an Introduction to Programming assessment allotted only the first week of this assessment time to complete, and some delay in organising our group and meeting for the first time, we quickly gathered steam and worked efficiently and to plan. It did, however, take several meetings before this plan was put in place, as none of our group members have participated in a group report project previously.</p> 
    
    <p>Aiden believes he could have expanded more on the group’s Project Idea with time, by researching the demand for crowdsourced data by local governments, and perhaps expanding on the financial feasibility of the project with estimated operating revenue and more expense analysis. He also believes the group far surpassed his effort, as most of this document was authored by other group members. It should be noted Aiden prepared the majority of the meeting notes, conducted the interview with Sally Longmore, and also contributed by reviewing and editing the group’s work before final submission. </p>

<h3>Helen</h3>
<img src="images/Helenandrews.jpg" align ="right" hspace="10" vspace = '10' width="30%" alt="Helen Andrews"  style="width:240px;height:250px;">
    <p>During the 3-4 weeks we worked together as a group we were able to achieve the assignment by the due date. This is encouraging as we had good communication and were able to meet regularly to check in on the group's progress and provide assistance where required.</p> 

    <p>Our group as a whole is quite good and worked well as a team to finalise the project. In future we could improve on how we plan the assignment and due dates for tasks. Setting dates to manage the project ensures everyone involved in the group knows what expectations we have and the target date for review we are set to achieve.</p> 
    
    <p>One thing that surprised me was how helpful the team were when a question was asked of them, at least one or many within the group replied with input to the question providing the appropriate answer to the question asked. I found this very helpful in a couple of scenarios I struggled with, and the team helped quickly and efficiently.</p> 
    
    <p>While working as a group I have learned that communication is key to ensure the project was kept on time for the due date. Without everyone contributing to the group we wouldn’t have known what stage the project was at or when it was nearing completion. </p>

<h3>Joshua</h3>

        <p>Overall, our work as a group has been good in my opinion. One of the most important things that went well was work division. I believe we did a good job of making each person’s responsibilities clear. We also succeeded, in my opinion, in supporting and helping each other to complete the required work in a reasonable time frame, despite losing some time early on. Something we didn’t do, however, was set internal deadlines. This is something that I believe we would benefit from in the future, as we would have benefited from completing some of the tasks earlier.</p>  

       <p>Something that surprised me about working in a group was the range of ages and backgrounds that were represented in our group. This is something that is somewhat different from an in-person university experience and is something that I believe has been to our benefit. One thing I have learned about working in groups is that it is important to make sure we are all on the same page about the deadlines that need to be met, and the work that is required of each member. I believe we did a reasonable job of this. However, if either of these are lacking, then the work of the group could easily devolve into an unorganized mess of confused and half-finished work. </p>

        <p>Initially, we were unsure, and as a new team, took a while to understand each other, but this was quickly overcome with the division of workload amongst us, and allowing us to focus on what we wanted to learn, or work to our strengths.</p> 

        <p>This division of work early on allowed each team member to focus on a set target, while learning the processes of running meetings, and planning the next steps. A meeting timetable was set with the consensus of all participants to ensure max availability for each member. Whilst our meeting schedule was met, and punctual, our meeting agendas were a bit lacking. Setting internal deadlines was also lacking, but the division of work early, and understanding what was required from each participant, negated any negative impacts.</p>  
            
        <p>As time progressed as we progressed through our workload, team communications improved, and more utilisation of the tools at hand was noted. With improved communication came more teamwork, especially regarding editing, and report content. Our audit trail became apparent as each individual input was captured with document comments and changes. </p> 
            
        <p>Overall, we have worked well as a team, and met the requirements of the assessment, in learning to work together to achieve a common gaol. </p>
