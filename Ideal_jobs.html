        <p>In general, our ideal jobs are all remarkably similar except for Robert. Most of us are looking at going in the direction of being a Software Developer/Engineer. Robert’s ideal job is as a Business Developer. </p>

        <p><b>What common elements are there, if any?  </b></p>
        <p>The most common element across all our group's ideal jobs is that almost every job has teamwork, problem-solving and written and verbal communication skills as a requirement. As most of us are looking at going in the Software Developer/Engineer direction, these jobs all have a deep understanding of writing code as a similarity. </p>

        <p><b>What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? </b></p>
        <p>Robert’s ideal job is the only one that is different as it is a business development job and is not directly related to IT. It has some elements of IT as it is a job that requires technical knowledge of the products that the company makes. The job also requires basic computer skills such as familiarity with Microsoft Office.</p>

        <p>As for the rest of the group, each job differentiates itself as each employer has their own specific set of coding/platform skills depending on what type of systems the employer will be using.</p>

        <p><b>How similar or different are your career plans across the group? </b></p>

        <p>Most of us have very similar career plans as we are all interested in a job that heavily involves coding, whether that is building websites, games or creating apps.</p>

        <p>Robert is the only one in the group whose job is different as his ideal job is a business development role. This role entails finding new customers and identifying ways to grow the business rather than being directly involved in the IT side of the business.</p>
