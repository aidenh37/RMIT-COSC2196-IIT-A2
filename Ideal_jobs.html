<p><b>Ideal Jobs</b></p>
<p>In general, our ideal jobs are all remarkably similar with the exception of Robert. Most of us are looking at going in the direction of being a Software Developer/Engineer. Robert’s ideal job is as a Business Developer. </p>

<p><b>What common elements are there, if any?  </b></p>
<p>The most common element across all our group's ideal jobs is that almost every job has teamwork, problem solving and written and verbal communication skills as a requirement. As most of us are looking at going in the Software Developer/Engineer direction, these jobs all have a deep understanding of writing code as a similarity. </p>

<p><b>What differentiates each position from the others, if anything? </b></p>
<p>Robert’s ideal job is the only one that is really different as it is a business development job and is not directly related to IT. It has some elements of IT as it is a job that requires technical knowledge of the products that the company makes. The job also requires basic computer skills such as familiarity with Microsoft office.  </p>
<p>As for the rest of the group, each job has their own specific set of coding/platform skills depending on what type of systems they are using. </p>

<p><b>How similar or different are your career plans across the group? </b></p>
<p>Most of us have very similar career plans as we are all interested in a job that heavily involves coding, whether that is building websites, games or creating apps. </p>
<p>Robert is the only one in the group whose job is different as his is a business development role. This role entails finding new customers and identifying ways to grow the business rather than being directly involved in the IT side of the business. </p>
